I am a PhD student at <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/">The Johns Hopkins University</a> in the department of Applied Math and Statistics. My work primarily focuses in optimization, under the supervision of  <a href="https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~grimmer/">Benjamin Grimmer</a>. In particular, I work on expanding classical theory to apply universally to Lipschitz functions, functions with Lipschitz gradients, and everywhere in between. In a dual notion, my work also focuses on functions that are convex, strongly convex, and anywhere in between.
